Many somatic sexually dimorphic features of Drosophila melanogaster are the results of gene expression regulated by the doublesex (dsx) gene, which encodes sex-specific transcription factors (DSX(F) in females and DSX(M) in males). Rapid changes in such sexually dimorphic features are likely a result of changes at the regulatory sequence of the target genes. We focused on the Flavin-containing monooxygenase-2 (Fmo-2) gene, a likely direct dsx target, to elucidate how sexually dimorphic expression and its evolution are brought about. We found that dsx is deployed to regulate the Fmo-2 transcription both in the midgut and in fat body cells of the spermatheca (a female-specific tissue), through a canonical DSX-binding site in the Fmo-2 regulatory sequence. In the melanogaster group, Fmo-2 transcription in the midgut has evolved rapidly, in contrast to the conserved spermathecal transcription. We identified two cis-regulatory modules (CRM-p and CRM-d) that direct sexually monomorphic or dimorphic Fmo-2 transcription, respectively, in the midguts of these species. Changes of Fmo-2 transcription in the midgut from sexually dimorphic to sexually monomorphic in some species are caused by the loss of CRM-d function, but not the loss of the canonical DSX-binding site. Thus, conferring transcriptional regulation on a CRM level allows the regulation to evolve rapidly in one tissue while evading evolutionary constraints posed by other tissues.

In the present study, we investigated the influence of BISA (5, 25, and 250 μmol/L) on rotenone (500 μmol/L)-induced toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster for 7 days. BISA supplementation significantly decreased rotenone-induced mortality and locomotor deficits. The loss of motor function induced by rotenone correlated with a significant change in stress response factors; it decreased thiol levels, inhibited mitochondria complex I, and increased the mRNA expression of antioxidant marker proteins such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and the keap1 gene product. Taken together, our findings indicate that the toxicity of rotenone is likely due to the direct inhibition of complex I activity, resulting in a high level of oxidative stress. Dietary supplementation with BISA affected the expression of SOD mRNA only at a concentration of 250 μmol/L, and did not affect any other parameter measured. Our results showed a protective effect of BISA on rotenone-induced mortality and locomotor deficits in Drosophila; this effect did not correlate with mitochondrial complex I activity, but may be related to the antioxidant protection afforded by eliminating superoxide generated as a result of rotenone-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.' publications.doi='10.1139/cjpp-2017-0207' publications.firstAuthor='Leite Gerlânia de Oliveira' publications.id=1449783 publications.issue='4' publications.journal='Can.

Autophagy operates at basal levels in all cells where it serves as a homeostatic mechanism to maintain cellular integrity. The levels and cargoes of autophagy can, however, change in response to a variety of stimuli, and perturbations in autophagy are known to be involved in the aetiology of various human diseases. Autophagy must therefore be tightly controlled. We report here that the Drosophila cyclin-dependent kinase PITSLRE is a modulator of autophagy. Loss of the human PITSLRE orthologue, CDK11, initially appears to induce autophagy, but at later time points CDK11 is critically required for autophagic flux and cargo digestion. Since PITSLRE/CDK11 regulates autophagy in both Drosophila and human cells, this kinase represents a novel phylogenetically conserved component of the autophagy machinery.' publications.doi='10.4161/auto.7.11.16646' publications.firstAuthor='Wilkinson Simon' publications.id=4716795 publications.issue='11' publications.journal='Autophagy' publications.month='Nov' publications.pages='1295-301' publications.pubMedId='21808150' publications.title='The cyclin-dependent kinase PITSLRE/CDK11 is required for successful autophagy.' publications.volume='7' publications.year=2011\nGene: publications.abstractText='(dpp), a low-threshold target of the pathway while the high-threshold targets remained unaffected.

Many somatic sexually dimorphic features of Drosophila melanogaster are the results of gene expression regulated by the doublesex (dsx) gene, which encodes sex-specific transcription factors (DSX(F) in females and DSX(M) in males). Rapid changes in such sexually dimorphic features are likely a result of changes at the regulatory sequence of the target genes. We focused on the Flavin-containing monooxygenase-2 (Fmo-2) gene, a likely direct dsx target, to elucidate how sexually dimorphic expression and its evolution are brought about. We found that dsx is deployed to regulate the Fmo-2 transcription both in the midgut and in fat body cells of the spermatheca (a female-specific tissue), through a canonical DSX-binding site in the Fmo-2 regulatory sequence. In the melanogaster group, Fmo-2 transcription in the midgut has evolved rapidly, in contrast to the conserved spermathecal transcription. We identified two cis-regulatory modules (CRM-p and CRM-d) that direct sexually monomorphic or dimorphic Fmo-2 transcription, respectively, in the midguts of these species. Changes of Fmo-2 transcription in the midgut from sexually dimorphic to sexually monomorphic in some species are caused by the loss of CRM-d function, but not the loss of the canonical DSX-binding site. Thus, conferring transcriptional regulation on a CRM level allows the regulation to evolve rapidly in one tissue while evading evolutionary constraints posed by other tissues.

In the present study, we investigated the influence of BISA (5, 25, and 250 μmol/L) on rotenone (500 μmol/L)-induced toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster for 7 days. BISA supplementation significantly decreased rotenone-induced mortality and locomotor deficits. The loss of motor function induced by rotenone correlated with a significant change in stress response factors; it decreased thiol levels, inhibited mitochondria complex I, and increased the mRNA expression of antioxidant marker proteins such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and the keap1 gene product. Taken together, our findings indicate that the toxicity of rotenone is likely due to the direct inhibition of complex I activity, resulting in a high level of oxidative stress. Dietary supplementation with BISA affected the expression of SOD mRNA only at a concentration of 250 μmol/L, and did not affect any other parameter measured. Our results showed a protective effect of BISA on rotenone-induced mortality and locomotor deficits in Drosophila; this effect did not correlate with mitochondrial complex I activity, but may be related to the antioxidant protection afforded by eliminating superoxide generated as a result of rotenone-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.' publications.doi='10.1139/cjpp-2017-0207' publications.firstAuthor='Leite Gerlânia de Oliveira' publications.id=1449783 publications.issue='4' publications.journal='Can.

Autophagy operates at basal levels in all cells where it serves as a homeostatic mechanism to maintain cellular integrity. The levels and cargoes of autophagy can, however, change in response to a variety of stimuli, and perturbations in autophagy are known to be involved in the aetiology of various human diseases. Autophagy must therefore be tightly controlled. We report here that the Drosophila cyclin-dependent kinase PITSLRE is a modulator of autophagy. Loss of the human PITSLRE orthologue, CDK11, initially appears to induce autophagy, but at later time points CDK11 is critically required for autophagic flux and cargo digestion.
